## Which tools are able to display the dynamic dependencies for binaries on Linux?
file, ldd
## What is the practical problem with dynamic linking when you want to install your program on a different system, e.g. a Virtual Machine?
The loader searches for shared libraries in predefined system directories. Generally this means that they aren't very portable which is very important when copying the programm to other OSes
## How can you get more information about an item in the menuconfig?

sys 	- 0m 20,249s (CPU time spent in the kernel)
## Where and which are the output binary files produced by the compilation?
The binary files are produced in the arch/x86/boot/ folder
a20.o
bioscall.o
cmdline.o
copy.o

## Which TTY-device do you need to pass to the kernel for console input/output?
